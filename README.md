# ☕ My First Sales Dashboard – Café Sales Trends Analysis
<h3>I created my first interactive sales dashboard (with a little help!) to explore sales trends in a fictional café. Built entirely in Excel, the dashboard is fully responsive and allows for dynamic exploration of the data.

Key features:

📊 Analysis of sales based on loyalty card usage, roast type, and coffee weight (kg)

⏳ An interactive timeline that reveals how sales patterns change over different time periods

📈 Insights into customer behavior and product performance

This project helped me improve my data analysis, visualization, and storytelling skills all within Excel!
